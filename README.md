> # TemplateAPI
 This is a simple, responsive, easy to use [Image REST(ful) API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api) which has a simple, modern stylish page made for the [2022 Replit Template Jam](https://blog.replit.com/template-jam). You can use it and make it yours by changing things and colors to your style and liking! I made it with a lot of hard work, love and of course with code :) I'm not a professional coder, but i tried my best to make it look cool and yet still keep it simple. I would like to give a large shoutout to [Buddy](https://replit.com/@bddy) from the [Replit Discord Server](https://replit.com/discord) (aka the guy who made [ReplChat](https://replit.com/@bddy/replchat)) for providing me with the CSS used (thanks alot!).

 I have learned so much  while making this template, especially about how APIs even actually work back-end all this time!

 > # I have used:
- [x] HTML 5 for markup
- [x] Pure CSS 3 for styling
- [x] JS for the API

You can add more things to make it even cooler! The comments in the code will help you navigate through it. Have a nice day! :D

Feel free to contribute to the code but do not steal the code and post it everywhere as your work and if you want to use the template don't forget to give the credit

> # How to use:
1. Install all dependencies (`npm ci`)
2. Go to `config.json` and change variables required (Change "URL" to your repl URL, change "Images" to the number of images currently in your repl)
3. Run the code by pressing the RUN button or by typing `node api.js` into the console
